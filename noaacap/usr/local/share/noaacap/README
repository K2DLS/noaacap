This software is written in python 3.4 and has been tested with aprx 2.9.x.
If you are running a version < 2.9.0 you should first update aprx.  The current
release may be found at http://thelifeofkenneth.com/aprx/debs/.

Once you are running aprx >= 2.9, install noaacap:

Install via sudo dpkg -i noaacap-0.6.deb.  Then, to satisfy the dependencies,
run sudo apt-get -f install.

CONFIGURATION

Add a beacon section similar to the following to /etc/aprx.conf:

<beacon>

beaconmode both
cycle-size 2m

beacon via WIDE2-1 \
   srccall N0CALL-13 \
   timeout 20 \
   exec /usr/local/bin/noaacap.py

</beacon>

The timeout was needed on my older and slower single core Raspberry Pi Model B.
The aprx default timeout is 10 seconds and the timeout may not be needed on a
RPi 2 or newer.  If you need lots of "BEACON EXEC abnormal close" messages in
aprx.log, then you likely need to add the timeout.

The program will check for a new alert or update every 2 minutes, but only
send if there is a change.

Edit /etc/noaacap.conf:

Do not remove the [noaacap] section header.

myTZ should be set to the Linux TZ value for the issuing office of your
preferred weather zone.  For a complete list of timezones, you may use
the following command:  timedatectl list-timezones | grep America.

myZone should be set to your county code.  A list of county codes may be found
at https://alerts.weather.gov/.  Only list one county.  The program will then
send the alert for all affected zones.  You could instead use a zone code if
you want to be more specific.

USE

It would be good to hear from users of this software.  Please email
k2dls@k2dls.net with the callsign-SSID of your APRS station that is sending
weather alerts via this program.
